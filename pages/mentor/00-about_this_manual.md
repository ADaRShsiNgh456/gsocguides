This manual was written during a Book Sprint sponsored by Google and facilitated by FLOSS Manuals. The manual was written in two days but the maintenance of the manual is an ongoing process to which you may wish to contribute. A second sprint occurred in 2010 to update the manual (adding the Org Admin section) and write the Students Guide ("Flipping Bits not Burgers"). Another brief edit occured February 2017 to update and reflect the new website and program changes.

Since the manual may be updated at any time, you may wish to periodically check here for updated versions:
